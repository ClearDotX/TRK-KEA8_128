During this period the Licensee may not disclose NXP's Confidential Information to any third party except where such disclosure is necessary in order to achieve the purpose of the license because the automotive customer requires disclosure in conjunction with the testing or purchase of an Authorized System and who have executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Confidential Information. During this period Licensee will also limit dissemination of the Confidential Information to its employees or contractors who have a need to know of the Confidential Information and who have executed written agreements obligating them to protect such Confidential Information, and may not use the NXP's Confidential Information for any purpose or in any manner not authorized by this Agreement. The Licensee further agrees to use the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, with NXP's Confidential Information as it would with its own confidential information.
