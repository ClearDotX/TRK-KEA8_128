User Guide 
1) Overview:
This example demonstrates the LIN communication between S12VR32 Master and Slave using unconditional frames.
2) Hardware requirements
- 1 PE Micro Multi-link universal
- 2 X-S12VR32V boards
- 1 LIN cable
- 2 Power Adapter 12V
- 6 single Dupont female to female cables
- 4 Led, 4 resistor 1K ohms
- 1 Personal Computer
3) Tool chain requirements
- CodeWarrior IDE v5.1
- Service Pack: CodeWarrior for HCS12(X) Microcontrollers v5.1 (Final)
4) Hardware settings
- For master node, plug jumper J11
- Led and resistor connected as below

	|PS2 (pin 17 of J202)|----|External resistor 1K|----(External LED1)----|GND|
	 
	|PS3 (pin 20 of J202)|----|External resistor 1K|----(External LED2)----|GND|


5) Prepare the example
	5.1) Use single Dupont female to female cable to connect pin 18 of J202 to resistor, resistor to anode of led, Cathode of led to GND on both X-S12VR32V Master and Slave boards.
	5.2) Use single Dupont female to female cable to connect pin 21 of J202 to resistor, resistor to anode of led, Cathode of led to GND on both X-S12VR32V Master and Slave boards.
	5.3) Use LIN cable to connect J1 of X-S12VR32V Master to J1 of X-S12VR32V Slave
	5.4) Plug power connector of Adapters 12V to J55 of X-S12VR32V Master and Slave boards.
	5.5) Open example projects on CodeWarrior 5.1, build projects and download the programs to boards.

6)Run the example
	6.1) After reset, LED1 of both boards always toggles for every 125ms.
	6.2) LED2 of both boards are on for about 9s.
	6.3) Afterwards, LED2 of both boards toggles forever.
